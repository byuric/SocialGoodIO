# Github.js

Github.js provides a minimal higher-level wrapper around git's [plumbing commands](http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Internals-Plumbing-and-Porcelain), exposing an API for manipulating GitHub repositories on the file level. It is being developed in the context of [Prose](http://prose.io), a content editor for GitHub.

This repo is now officially maintained by [DevelopmentSeed](https://github.com/developmentseed), the people behind [Prose.io](http://prose.io).

## Usage

Create a Github instance.

```js
var github = new Github({
  username: "YOU_USER",
  password: "YOUR_PASSWORD",
  auth: "basic"
});
```

Or if you prefer OAuth, it looks like this:

```js
var github = new Github({
  token: "OAUTH_TOKEN"
  auth: "oauth"
});
```

## Repository API


```js
var repo = github.getRepo(username, reponame);
```

Show repository information

```js
repo.show(function(err, repo) {});
```

Get contents at a particular path.

```js
repo.contents("path/to/dir", function(err, contents) {});
```

Fork repository. This operation runs asynchronously. You may want to poll for `repo.contents` until the forked repo is ready.

```js
repo.fork(function(err) {});
```

Create Pull Request.

```js
var pull = {
  title: message,
  body: "This pull request has been automatically generated by Prose.io.",
  base: "gh-pages",
  head: "michael" + ":" + "prose-patch",
};
repo.createPullRequest(pull, function(err, pullRequest) {});
```


Retrieve all available branches (aka heads) of a repository.

```js
repo.listBranches(function(err, branches) {});
```

Store contents at a certain path, where files that don't yet exist are created on the fly.

```js
repo.write('master', 'path/to/file', 'YOUR_NEW_CONTENTS', 'YOUR_COMMIT_MESSAGE', function(err) {});
```

Not only can you can write files, you can of course read them.

```js
repo.read('master', 'path/to/file', function(err, data) {});
```

Move a file from A to B.

```js
repo.move('master', 'path/to/file', 'path/to/new_file', function(err) {});
```

Remove a file.

```js
repo.remove('master', 'path/to/file', function(err) {});
```

Exploring files of a repository is easy too by accessing the top level tree object.

```js
repo.getTree('master', function(err, tree) {});
```

If you want to access all blobs and trees recursively, you can add `?recursive=true`.

```js
repo.getTree('master?recursive=true', function(err, tree) {});
```

Given a filepath, retrieve the reference blob or tree sha.

```js
repo.getSha('master', '/path/to/file', function(err, sha) {});
```

For a given reference, get the corresponding commit sha.

```js
repo.getRef('heads/master', function(err, sha) {});
```

Create a new reference.

```js
var refSpec = {
  "ref": "refs/heads/my-new-branch-name",
  "sha": "827efc6d56897b048c772eb4087f854f46256132"
};
repo.createRef(refSpec, function(err) {});
```

Delete a reference.

```js
repo.deleteRef('heads/gh-pages', function(err) {});
```


## User API


```js
var user = github.getUser();
```

List all repositories of the authenticated user, including private repositories and repositories in which the user is a collaborator and not an owner.

```js
user.repos(function(err, repos) {});
```

List organizations the autenticated user belongs to.

```js
user.orgs(function(err, orgs) {});
```

List authenticated user's gists.

```js
user.gists(username, function(err, gists) {});
```

Show user information for a particular username. Also works for organizations.

```js
user.show(username, function(err, user) {});
```

List public repositories for a particular user.

```js
user.userRepos(username, function(err, repos) {});
```

List repositories for a particular organization. Includes private repositories if you are authorized.

```js
user.orgRepos(orgname, function(err, repos) {});
```

List all gists of a particular user. If username is ommitted gists of the current authenticated user are returned.

```js
user.userGists(username, function(err, gists) {});
```

## Gist API

```js
var gist = github.getGist(3165654);
```

Read the contents of a Gist.

```js
gist.read(function(err, gist) {

});
```

Updating the contents of a Git. Please consult the documentation on [GitHub](http://developer.github.com/v3/gists/). 

```js
var delta = {
  "description": "the description for this gist",
  "files": {
    "file1.txt": {
      "content": "updated file contents"
    },
    "old_name.txt": {
      "filename": "new_name.txt",
      "content": "modified contents"
    },
    "new_file.txt": {
      "content": "a new file"
    },
    "delete_this_file.txt": null
  }
};

gist.update(delta, function(err, gist) {
  
});
```


## Tests

Github.js is automaticallyâ„¢ tested by the users of [Prose](http://prose.io). Because of that, we decided to save some time by not maintaining a test suite. Yes, you heard right. :) However, you can still consider it stable since it is used in production.

##Setup

Github.js has the following dependencies:

- Underscore
- Base64 (for basic auth). You can leave this if you are not using basic auth.

Include these before github.js :

```
<script src="lib/underscore-min.js">
<script src="lib/base64.js">
<script src="github.js">
```
