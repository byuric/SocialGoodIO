SocialGoodIO
============

SocialGood I/O is an Exchange Platform for Social Good where:
* Anyone (Individuals/Corpotates) can list an experience/product that will be provided as a prize in return for SocialGood contribution in a challange (wraffle). Will be called "Provider"
* Challanges will be moderated and editted based on the Terms Of Use of the Exchange Platform
* People can participate in the wraffle by sharing the challange to their social networks (Connected Social networks - Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, Google+, VKontakte). These participants will be called "Contributor"
* Winners (up to N winners) will be picked randomly based on their SocialGood credit they contributed towards the challange that will be called "Winner"
* The chances of winning in the challange depend on the SocialGood credit that the contributor put in to the challange
* SocialGood I/O will make sure that "Provider" delivers the offered prizes to all the "Winner"s
* Challange will be active from 7 to 30 days. 

How to SocialGood Credits are calculated?
* When Contributor shares the challange to his Social Network timeline e.g. FB => SocialGood credits = number of friends that this Contributor has. 
* If Contributor shared to more than one network, his SocialGood contribution will be the aggregate of all the potential friends and followers who could see the promotion of the Challange. 
* If Contributor A friends shared the Challange to their network as a result of SocialGood sharing, Contributor A and B will get points.
* Contributor can share the challange only once a day. All the contributions will be aggregated toward single SocialGood credit that is provided for select Challange.
* SocialGood credits can be bought with real money $1 = 1000 SocialGood credits
* Contributor will be reminded before the end of the Challange with a list of top Contributors and his winning chances (Probability). Contributor will be able to buy SocialGood credits at any point of time before the end of the challange. 

SocialGood Fund:
All the credits collected from all the SocialGood challanges will be collected towards SocialGood Fund that will support Social Entrepreneurs and Social Good projects around the world. 
Fund Size $$$ = Total SocialGood Credits/1000
